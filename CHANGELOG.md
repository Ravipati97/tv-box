## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-22

First version-tracked release. TV Box has been in daily use by the group
since 2026-08-13 -- this snapshot is everything it does as of today.

### Added

- Simple email + username sign-in, with an optional shared passcode gate.
- Per-episode watch tracking, show and season ratings, and a Now Watching
  home page with per-season progress.
- Watchlist, custom shareable lists, and a yearly recap.
- Diary: a unified, chronological log of everything watched, rated, and
  rewatched.
- Rewatch logging as its own append-only event, separate from first-time
  watch progress.
- Activity feed of what the group's been finishing and rating, plus
  member directory and public profiles.
- Bulk "mark all/season watched" with a date picker, for backfilling shows
  watched before TV Box existed.
- An "Upcoming" section aggregating next air dates across everything
  currently being watched.
- One clear streaming answer per show (where to watch it), correctable by
  anyone in the group.
- Light and dark themes, following system preference by default.
- Installable as a home-screen app on iOS, with a custom app icon that
  adapts to light/dark mode.

### Fixed

Numerous rounds of hardening since launch: timezone-correct air dates and
date pickers, mobile layout/keyboard/scroll bugs, error handling and
optimistic-UI rollback, reduced-motion support, and accessibility
(focus/escape handling, touch targets).
